# README Generator
## Description
This template was actually created by the file generator that I used for this project. This application does as its' name says, it generates README files using information that the user types in. It also includes a link to the walkthrough video on how to use the file so that the user doesn't have to use node in order to see what the generated file will look like.

This project might be used in the future, with a bit more fine tuning, to generate more easy readme files!
